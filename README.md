# JS practice

Simple tasks:

1. Count and display in the console the number of categories
2. Write a script that, for each element in the ingredients array:
   Will create a separate <li> element. Be sure to use the document.createElement() method.
   Will add the ingredient name as its text content.
   Will add the item class to the element.
   Then will insert all <li> to the ul#ingredients list in a single operation.
3. Write a script to create a gallery of images from an array of data.
4. The counter consists of a span and buttons, which, when clicked, should increase and decrease its value by one.
5. Write a script that, when typing in the input#name-input input (input event), substitutes its current value into span#name-output. If the input is empty, the span should display the "Anonymous" string.
6. Write a script that, when focus on input is lost (blur event), checks its contents for the correct number of entered characters.
7. Write a script that responds to changes in the value of input#font-size-control (input event) and changes the inline style of span#text by updating the font-size property. As a result, the text size will change responding to scrollbar dragging.
8. Write a script to manage the login form.
9. Write a script that changes the background colors of the <body> element via inline style when clicking on button.change-color and outputs the color value to span.color.
